This is a Weather App for the browser. It was programmed in Visual Studio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

This project was part of the SheCodes webdevelopment course and it uses the SheCodes API to get the weather data.

The icons were created by 'iconixar' and provided by Flaticon: https://www.flaticon.com/authors/iconixar

For deployment I used Netlify. The actual app can be seen here: https://unique-yeot-45768b.netlify.app
